# Repository Configuration Settings

This document explains the settings configured in our repository's [settings JSON](https://github.com/sociail/.github/blob/dev/.github/configs/settings.json). These settings help maintain code quality, ensure secure development practices, and streamline our development process.

## Settings Overview

### Required Status Checks
- **strict**: When set to `true`, requires that the base branch be up-to-date before merging a pull request. This ensures that changes pass all tests with the latest code.
- **contexts**:
  - `ci/build`: Requires each pull request to pass build tests.
  - `ci/test`: Requires each pull request to pass automated tests.

### Enforce Admins
- **enforce_admins**: When set to `true`, the rules applied to pull requests also apply to administrators. This ensures all changes are reviewed, regardless of the author.

### Required Pull Request Reviews
- **dismiss_stale_reviews**: When set to `true`, any previous approvals are dismissed when new commits are pushed to a pull request. This ensures reviews are always for the latest changes.
- **require_code_owner_reviews**: When set to `false`, code owner reviews are not required. This may be practical for small teams.
- **required_approving_review_count**: Specifies the number of required approvals for a pull request to be merged. Set to `1` to streamline the process.

### Restrictions
- **restrictions**: When set to `null`, there are no specific user or team restrictions for pushing to the repository. Assumes a small team where all members might need push access.

### Allow Force Pushes
- **allow_force_pushes**: When set to `false`, force pushes are disabled to preserve the integrity of the project history.

### Allow Deletions
- **allow_deletions**: When set to `false`, deletion of branches is prevented to avoid losing work.

### Required Linear History
- **required_linear_history**: When set to `true`, enforces a linear commit history which simplifies understanding changes and the history of the project.

### Block Creations
- **block_creations**: When set to `false`, allows creation of new branches freely. Useful for fostering innovation and experimentation among team members.

### Required Conversation Resolution
- **required_conversation_resolution**: When set to `true`, ensures all discussion threads in pull requests are resolved before merging. Promotes thorough discussion and resolution of issues.

### Protect Matched Branches
- **protect_matched_branches**: When set to `false`, no specific protection rules are applied to branches based on naming patterns. Allows flexibility in branch management.

## Conclusion

These settings are designed to maintain high standards of code quality and to ensure that all team members follow a consistent workflow. Adjust these settings as necessary to better fit the dynamics of your team and the goals of your project.
